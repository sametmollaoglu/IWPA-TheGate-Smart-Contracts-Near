# The Gate: Infinite Quest - IWPA Token Smart Contracts

The Gate: Infinite Quest is a GPS location-based, multiplayer, item-quest mobile game where players aim to solve mysteries, compete with others, and build the world's largest collection of rare treasures. In this game, players can embark on exciting quests, discover hidden treasures around them using GPS location, and engage in multiplayer challenges.

The project especially includes the development of the "IWPA" in-game token, which will be used for various in-game transactions, rewards, and interactions. The smart contracts in this repository facilitate token creation, token vesting, and crowdsale of the "IWPA" token.
